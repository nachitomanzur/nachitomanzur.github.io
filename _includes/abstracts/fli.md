We introduce two folding schemes for lookup instances: FLI and FLI+SOS. Both use a PIOP to check that a matrix has elementary basis vectors as rows, with FLI+SOS adding a twist based on Lasso's SOS-decomposability.

FLI takes two lookup instances $$\{\mathbf{a}_1\}, \{\mathbf{a}_2\}\subseteq\mathbf{t}$$, and expresses them as matrix equations $$M_i\cdot\mathbf{t}^\mathsf{T}=\mathbf{a}_i^\mathsf{T}$$ for $$i=1,2$$, where each matrix $$M_i\in\mathbb{F}^{m\times N}$$ has rows which are elementary basis vectors in $$\mathbb{F}^N$$. Matrices that satisfy this condition are said to be in $$R_{\mathsf{elem}}$$.

Then, a folding scheme for $$R_{\mathsf{elem}}$$ into a relaxed relation is used, which combines the matrices $$M_1, M_2$$ as $$M_1+\alpha M_2$$ for a random $$\alpha\in\mathbb{F}$$. Finally, the lookup equations are combined as $$(M_1+\alpha M_2)\cdot \mathbf{t}^{\mathsf{T}} = (\mathbf{a}_1+\alpha \mathbf{a}_2)^\mathsf{T}$$. In FLI, only the property that a matrix is in $$R_{\mathsf{elem}}$$ is folded, and this makes the FLI folding step the cheapest among existing solutions.

The price to pay is in the cost for proving accumulated instances. FLI+SOS builds upon FLI to enable folding of large SOS-decomposable tables. This is achieved through a variation of Lasso's approach to SOS-decomposability, which fits FLI naturally. For comparison, we describe (for the first time to our knowledge) straightforward variations of Protostar and Proofs for Deep Thought that also benefit from SOS-decomposability.

We see that for many reasonable parameter choices, and especially those arising from lookup-based zkVMs, FLI+SOS can concretely be the cheapest folding solution.
