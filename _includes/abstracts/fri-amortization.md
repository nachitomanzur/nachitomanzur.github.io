We present two techniques to improve the computational and/or communication costs of STARK proofs: packing and modular split-and-pack. Packing allows to generate a single proof of the satisfiability of several constraints. We achieve this by packing the evaluations of all relevant polynomials in the same Merkle leaves, and combining all DEEP FRI functions into a single randomized validity function.

Our benchmarks show that packing reduces the verification time and proof size compared to individually proving the satisfiability of each witness, while only increasing the prover time moderately. Modular split-and-pack is a proof acceleration technique where the prover divides a witness into smaller sub-witnesses. It then uses packing to prove the simultaneous satisfiability of each sub-witness.

Compared to producing a proof of the original witness, splitting improves the prover time and memory usage, while increasing the verifier time and proof size.

Ideas similar to modular split-and-pack seem to be used throughout the industry, but 1) generally execution traces are split by choosing the first $$k$$ rows, then the next $$k$$ rows, and so on; and 2) full recursion is used to prove the simultaneous satisfiability of the sub-witnesses, usually combined with a final wrapper proof (typically a Groth16 proof). We present a different way to split the witness that allows for an efficient re-writing of Plonkish-type constraints.

Based on our benchmarks, we believe this approach (together with a wrapper proof) can improve upon existing splitting methods, resulting in a faster prover at essentially no cost in proof size and verification time. Both techniques apply to popular FRI-based proof systems such as ethSTARK, Plonky2/3, RISC Zero, and Boojum.
