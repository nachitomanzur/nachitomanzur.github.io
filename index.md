    <p><strong>Ignacio Manzur</strong><br>
    I am a second-year PhD student at EPFL COMPSEC Lab, where I am advised by [Alessandro Chiesa](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/). Before that, I worked as a Cryptography Researcher at [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/cryptography-research) for around 2 years. I have a MASt in Pure Mathematics (Part III) from the University of Cambridge.
    I am broadly interested in coding theory, the interaction between complexity theory and probabilistic proof/argument systems, and quantum computing. </p>
